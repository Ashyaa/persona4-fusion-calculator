# Persona 4 Fusion Calculator
An AngularJS app to compute how to make a precise persona.

Vastly inspired by the work of arantius, all credits for the original idea and concept goes to him.

I know there is no price yet, I don't know how to compute it precisely. It also depends on your compendium completion percentage, so I don't know how to procede. Any help will be appreciated !

I will update this for the upcoming Persona 5, I just need to create new data.
