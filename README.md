### Persona 4 Fusion Calculator

---

An AngularJS app to compute how to make a precise persona.

Vastly inspired by the work of arantius, all credits for the original idea and concept goes to him.
Check his stuff on https://github.com/arantius/persona-fusion-calculator
or view it live on http://arantius.github.io/persona-fusion-calculator/


I know there is no price yet, I don't know how to compute it precisely. It also depends on your compendium completion percentage, so I don't know how to procede. Any help will be appreciated !

Here is a live version of this application:

### About Persona 5

---

I will update this for the upcoming Persona 5, I just need to create new data.

I am planning on playing the japonese version as soon as possible to get it done, but I might be slow gathering all the data I need.

So any input is accepted! Be it a persona list for an arcana, a persona description (Name, rank and arcana) or a recipe (Magician + Priestess = X for instance) or a triangle fusion recipe. Anything will help the process go faster!

## WARNING: All of this is based on the supposition that the fusing system will be similar as the ones in P3 and P4!

It shouldn't be different, but if it was, getting a Persona 5 version will take much more time!
